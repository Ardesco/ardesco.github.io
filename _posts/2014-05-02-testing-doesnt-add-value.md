I was at the London Tester Gathering last night where the mystery speaker was Michael Bolton.During his talk he said something that caused me to pause:

>Testing is a cost of doing business, testing does not add value.

(I’m paraphrasing as I can’t remember the exact quote)

When it was said I had an alarm bell go off in my head (the sort that you get when you are testing a bit of software and suddenly something doesn’t feel right, so you stop and look around and try and work out what triggered that feeling because you know it’s probably a bug).

So I thought about it on the train on the way home and came to the conclusion that he is wrong, testing does add value.

Testing adds value because testing is not just a reactive discipline, it’s also a proactive discipline!

As a tester I look at code written by developers and find problems with it on a daily basis. I then report these problems so that they can be fixed and when the code goes live I like to think that I help those developers look even more awesome than they already are (Outside of the development community I regularly hear people say “Who wrote this shit” when something doesn’t work. I never hear people say “Who tested this shit”).

I agree that I’m not adding value at this point, if anything I’m adding cost. A worthwhile cost, but a cost never the less.

However as a tester I don’t just look at code produced by developers, I also get involved in planning and pre-planning and in my mind this is one of the most important testing activities I can perform.

I have been testing code for over 10 years now and during that time I have seen code that is awesome, code that looks like it was written by 100 drunken monkeys and a multitude of things in the middle. I have been involved in testing from many levels, from code reviews to running UAT workshops, from usability to security and all sorts of other things as well, even performance and load. I’ve been lucky, I’ve got to see a lot and because of this I have a broad range of experience. When I’m in planning/pre-planning sessions I can use all of this experience to add value.

How do I do this? I can help the PO shape the product. I can highlight things that I have seen implemented before and have been a disaster, and get them removed very early in the process. I can suggest additional value added features that I’ve seen before that the PO didn’t think of/didn’t know were possible. I can highlight things that may end up being extremely costly to test so that we can think of different ways to look at the problem that are more cost effective to implement.

But what is the number one thing I can do? I can turn a “Can we do this” into a “Should we do this” before it gets near a developer.

If that’s not adding value, I don’t know what is.
